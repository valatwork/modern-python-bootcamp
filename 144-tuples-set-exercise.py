# 1 - Create a variable called numbers which is a tuple with the the values 1, 2, 3 and 4 inside.

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# 2 - Create a variable called value which is a tuple with the the value 1 inside.

value = (1,) # the comma is necessary for the tuple

# 3 - Given the following variable:

values = [10,20,30]

# Create a variable called static_values which is the result of the values variable converted to a tuple

static_values = tuple(values)

# 4 - Given the following variable

stuff = [1,3,1,5,2,5,1,2,5]

# Create a variable called unique_stuff which is a set of only the unique values in the stuff list

unique_stuff = set(stuff)
