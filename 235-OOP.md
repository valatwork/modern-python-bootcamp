# Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP?

Object oriented programming is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a **class** or **object**.

**class** - a blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods (functions) and attributes (similar to keys in a dict).

**instance** - objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class's methods and properties.

## Why OOP?

With OOP, the goal is to *encapsulate* your code into **logical**, **hierarchical groups using classes* so that you can reason about your code at a higher level.

### Example

Say we want to model a game of poker in our program.
We could have the following entities:

* Game
* Player
* Card
* Deck
* Hand
* Chip
* Bet

Each entity could be its own class in our program

Card Deck using OOP

```python
deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()
hand1 = deck.deal_hand(5)
hand2 = deck.deal_hand(5)
print(hand1)
print(hand2)
deck.reset()
```
Card Deck pseudocode

**Deck {class}*

Note: Python does not support true private or public variables/attributes/methods, the convention is to add an underscore before the name.
This is to make it clear that it is only to be used inside a specific class

* ```_cards``` (private list attribute)
* ```_max_cards``` (private int attribute)
* ```shuffle``` (public method)
* ```deal_card``` (public method)
* ```deal_hand``` (public method)
* ```count``` (public method)

### Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the grouping of public and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making **abstraction** possible.

Example: 
* designing the Deck class, I make **cards** a private attribute (a list)
* I decide that the length of the cards should be accessed via a public method called **count()** -- i.e. **Deck.count()**

### Abstraction

**Abstraction** - exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods (aka the "inner workings") from users

Example: as a user of the **Deck** class, I never call **len(Deck.cards)**, only **Deck.count()** because **Deck.cards** is "abstracted away" for me
