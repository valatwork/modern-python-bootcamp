Variables are always assigned with the variable name on the left and the value on the right of the equals sign.
Variables must be assigned before they can be used.

Variables can be:

-assigned to other variables
-reassigned at any time
-assigned at the same time as other variables

python_is_awesome = 100
just_another_var = python_is_awesome
python_is_awesome = 1337  


Naming

-must must start with a letter or an underscore
-the rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscores
-names are case sensitive

Most Python programmers prefer to use standard style conventions when naming things:

- Most variables should be snake_case (underscores between words)
- Most variables should be also be lowercase, with some exceptions:
    - CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (e.g. PI = 3.14)
    - UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class 
- Variables that start and end with two underscores (called "dunder" for double underscore) are supposed to be private or left alone
