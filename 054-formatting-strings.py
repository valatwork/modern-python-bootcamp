fruit = "banana"
ripeness = "unripe"
print(f"The {fruit} is {ripeness}")

# print("The {} is {}" .format(fruit, ripeness)) old syntax, to keep in mind for Udemy as it runs an older Python version

# Using .format()

# first = "Venus"
# last = "Williams"
# formatted = "First Name: {}, Last Name: {}".format(first, last)
# Though Udemy's platform doesn't support f-string yet, I think it's a much nicer syntax:

# first = "Venus" 
# last = "Williams"
# formatted = f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}"
