# modern-python-bootcamp
 
I'm using this repo as my personal notebook while following Colt Steele's ("The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp")[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp].

The repo does NOT include transcripts, slides or anything that rips the course off.

Support Colt's excellent work and buy the course: it's beginner friendly and fun to watch.
