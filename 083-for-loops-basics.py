for item in iterable_object:
    # do something with item

# an iterable object is a collection of items, i.e. a list of numbers, a string, a range, etc.
# item references the current position of our iterator within the iterable
# it will iterate (run through) every item of the collection 
# and then go away when it has vitised all items

# for number in range(1,8):
#     print(number)

# for x in range (1,10):
#     print(x)
#     print(x*x)

# for letter in "coffee":
#    print(letter)

for letter in "coffee":
    print(letter*10)
