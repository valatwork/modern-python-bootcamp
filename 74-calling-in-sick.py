# In this exercise you will be given a few variables that will be set randomly to Boolean values (True  or False ):
    # actually_sick  - when you legit have the flu!
    # kinda_sick  - you're feeling under the weather and it's enough to treat yoself with a day off if you can spare it
    # hate_your_job  - work sucks, I know... 
# You're also given a random number of sick_days between 0 and 10.
# Finally, there is a variable called calling_in_sick  that you must set to True  or False  based on the following scenarios:
# Set to True if: 
    # you're actually_sick  and you have sick_days  remaining
    # you're kinda_sick  and hate_your_job  and you have sick_days  remaining
# Otherwise, set to False.
# The tests check that the value of calling_in_sick  is correct based on the conditions specified above.

# NO TOUCHING ======================================

from random import choice, randint

# randomly assigns values to these four variables
actually_sick = choice([True, False])
kinda_sick = choice([True, False])
hate_your_job = choice([True, False])
sick_days = randint(0, 10)

# NO TOUCHING ======================================
